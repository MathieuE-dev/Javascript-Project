# Javascript-Project

Hi ! In this folder you can find some small applications I've made to familiarize and train myself with Javascript. 

The first is a small application(CineApp) based on OMDb's open source API. The user enters a film name and the API finds it in its database. This displays the film's poster, rating, main actors, plot and many other details. I used a function to fetch the data from the API depending if the field is empty or not. If the field is empty this returns the request to "Please Enter A Movie Name" again. If the field isn't empty we'll check whether or not the film is present in the database. If the film is in the database, then all data concerning it is returned otherwise an error message is displayed.
